The goal of the experimental setting is to obtain several functional MRI tasks and a long diffusion MRI scan with synchronized physiological recordings, including gas contents with a gas analyzer (GA), eye tracking (ET; including the right eye position, pupil size, blinks, etc.), respiration tracking through a pneumatic respiration belt (RB), and finally MRI-compatible electrocardiogram (ECG).

The overall experimental setting can be summarized as follows:

```

The above graph can be broken down as follows:

1. **Signals generating from the Scanning Room**.
    In addition to the MR imagery produced by the scanner, the participant will be wearing the RB, the ECG leads, a nasal cannula to retrieve the expired gases, and finally their right eye will be recorded with the infrared camera of the ET.
    All those probes and devices carry signals outside the Scanning Room either through cables or tubes, with the access panel as the interface.
    The access panel also has a connector carrying the **trigger** signals generated by MR schemes, which indicate important events in the MRI acquisition (typically, one trigger pulse is generated for each new *repetition time* —TR—, e.g., with every fMRI volume).
1. **Syncbox**.
    A *NordicLabs Syncbox* receives TTL (transistor-transistor logic) triggers from the scanner.
    This box can just forward the triggers converted into other formats and/or manipulate them (e.g., filter, generate, etc.).

    | ![run-session-syncbox](../assets/images/trigger_box.jpg) |
    |:---:|
    | The *NordicLabs Syncbox* |

1. **Physiology recording hub (BIOPAC)**.
    We use the *{{ settings.biopac.model }}* ({{ settings.biopac.vendor }}, {{ settings.biopac.place }}) to record most of physiological signals.
    The main unit ({{ settings.biopac.model }}) has directly attached several additional modules for the reception and recording of several analogical signals from the Scanning Room (for the case of the RB and the ECG), and indirectly from the gas analyzer (see next item).
    The physiology recording hub also registers digital signals from the *stimuli presentation laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}) through the digital signal module (described below).
1. **Gas analyzer (GA)**.
    We use the *{{ settings.gas.model }}* ({{ settings.gas.vendor }}, {{ settings.gas.place }}).
    The GA is a device that continuously measures the amount of two gases (CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>) from a sample fed at the front of the device with a connected tube (this tube comes from inside of the Scanning Room and ends in the nasal cannula the participant is wearing, as shown in the graph).
1. **Eye tracker (ET)**.
    We use the *{{ settings.eyetracker.model }}* ({{ settings.eyetracker.vendor }}, {{ settings.eyetracker.place }}).
    Our particular variant «{{ settings.eyetracker.submodel }}» is composed of three main elements:
    (i) inside the scanner's bore, we place an arm that holds an infrared lens and camera sensor on one side and an infrared lamp that illuminates the {{ settings.eyetracker.eye }} eye of the subject through (ii) a special mirror to reflect the infrared spectrum; and (iii) a PC tower that receives the camera recordings, postprocesses the images and calculates the final parameters of interest (position of the eye, pupil size, etc.).
    The ET is also connected to the *Psychopy laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}), and communicates bi-directionally with it (e.g., to record logs or receive "messages" such as triggers or task events).
    The ET **is NOT connected to the BIOPAC**, with the implication that the ET data is not stored with the other physiological information.
1. **Stimuli presentation laptop**.
    The *Psychopy laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.psychopy | default("███") }}) has the *Psychopy* software install and with it, the task programs are executed.
    This experiment consists of three tasks: breath-holding task (*BHT*), resting-state fMRI (*rest*), and a quality-control task (*QCT*).
    This laptop also stores the data recorded by the ET at the end of the experiment.
1. **Physiology recording laptop**.
    The *AcqKnowledge laptop* ({{ secrets.hosts.acqknowledge | default("███") }}) runs the BIOPAC's *AcqKnowledge* software and with it, this computer records the signals and allows visualization of the data coming from the BIOPAC.
    All the inputs to the BIOPAC are multiplexed through into an Ethernet cable that is connected to this laptop.

### Gas analyzer {{ settings.gas.model }}: documentation and basics

The front of the gas analyzer (GA) looks like this:

![gaz-analyser-front](../assets/images/gaz-analyser-front.jpg "Gas Analyzer front")

It is critical to familiarize with the [GA's manual](../assets/files/GA_manual.pdf) to learn about its correct utilization.

### Physiological recording hub BIOPAC: documentation and devices

Get familiar with the BIOPAC setup and read through the [hardware documentation](https://www.biopac.com/wp-content/uploads/MP_Hardware_Guide.pdf).
The system is composed by the main unit ({{ settings.biopac.model }}; extreme left in the picture below), to which modules are attached depending on what signals are to be recorded.

![Biopac_setup](../assets/images/Biopac_setup.jpg "BIOPAC front side")

Additional modules in our settings are (from left to right in the above picture):

* The [{{ settings.biopac.digital }} (solid state relay driver unit)](../assets/files/STP100D.pdf) is used to input digital signals that must be recorded.
* The {{ settings.biopac.analog }} unit can receive up to 16 analog signals.
* The {{ settings.biopac.rb_unit }} unit records the signal coming from the respiration belt.
    This unit requires the pressure transducer and amplifier {{ settings.biopac.rb_trans }} unit to be connected at its front.
    The belt has a pneumatic sensor {{ settings.biopac.rb_sensor }} (see [product sheet](https://www.biopac.com/wp-content/uploads/TSD221-MRI.pdf)), that is connected to the pressure transducer {{ settings.biopac.rb_trans }} via the longer tube ({{ settings.biopac.rb_tube_long }} {{ settings.biopac.rb_tube_long_length }}).
* The {{ settings.biopac.ecg_unit }} unit records the electrical signal coming from the heart via three ECG leads.
    This unit requires the amplifier {{ settings.biopac.ecg_trans }} unit to be connected at its front.

In addition to the main unit, we have a data modem to feed digital signals into the SPT100D.
This modem is the [{{ settings.biopac.pinkbox_long }} (N-shaped, pink box)](../assets/files/MMBT-S_instruction_manual_v2.2.pdf):

![{{ settings.biopac.pinkbox }}](../assets/images/neurospec.jpg)


### Eye tracker {{ settings.eyetracker.model }}: documentation and basics

Get familiar with the setup and read through the [ET Instruction Manual](../assets/files/EL1000Plus_UserManual_1.0.20_GOP.pdf).

??? thanks "Thanks to Benedetta Franceschiello!"

      All the documentation about the ET is derived from Benedetta Franceschiello's user guide.
      We greatly appreciate her help with the device.

| **The ET is an *{{ settings.eyetracker.model }} ({{ settings.eyetracker.submodel }})***. The ET is composed of three major elements: the ET arm (left), which holds the lens and camera and an infrared lamp, the *Host Computer* (middle), and the infrared mirror (right) {: colspan=3} | | |

* The ET arm is an articulated support for the infrared camera and lens in one end and with an infrared lamp at the other end.
    The ET arm is installed inside the Scanning Room, inside the scanner's bore, standing on a transparent plexiglass panel tailored to the scanner's bed rail.
    Two lengthy cables (black for power and orange for signal) are passed through the access panel and connect the ET arm to the ET computer.
* The ET computer is a standard PC with customized software for the control of the ET.
* The infrared mirror is critical to be able to record the **{{ settings.eyetracker.eye }} eye** of the participant, and is mounted covering the standard mirror of the coil.

## Scanning protocols

The study will collect data with two different scanning protocols.
Most of what is described in the present SOPs addresses the *Reliability Imaging Protocol* that will be acquired on the {{ secrets.rooms.mri1 | default("███") }} scanner.
